# 4-Bit-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit
Designed and implemented a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog capable of performing basic arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU supports operations including addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shift operations. Developed with parameterized inputs and operation selector for flexibility and ease of simulation.
